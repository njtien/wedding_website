    <h2>Registry</h2>
    <p>
      What we want more than anything, is to be able to see our closest friends and family again. It has been so long since we've seen so many of you and we miss you so much. We are so excited to see all of you again, and the prospect of having all of you together
      with us makes us so incredibly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one of you is traveling great distances to share this day with us, from overseas, across the country, or up the west coast. We do not expect gifts from our weary travelers; We hope you'll believe us when we say that we truly believe your presence
      is the most brilliant present, and the one we hope for most.
    </p>

      </ul>
    </li>

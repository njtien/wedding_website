      <h2>To our wonderful friends and family</h2>
      <p>
        We have been together for 10 years. A decade! On 11.11, we will be celebrating our 11-year anniversary and wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
        We grew up on the east coast, lived in the midwest, and recently moved to the west coast. We tried <em>really</em> hard to find a place to have a wedding that would not be difficult for our guests to get to, but in the end, no matter where we
        chose, the majority if not all of our guests would have to travel by plane or at least car. We decided we might as well run with it and make it a destination wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
        It'll be quite an adventure and we really hope you can make the trip. We're so happy we'll get a chance to have all of you meet or reunite! We are so excited to see all of you again; it really has been much too long.
      </p>
      <p class="center">

      <h2>About Our Wedding</h2>
      <p>We are having a small, intimate wedding at a lodge built along the side of a waterfall. Our ceremony will take place out on the terrace underneath a heated tent. Dinner will be served inside. Guests are welcome to slip in and out of doors throughout the evening to
        enjoy the view of falls.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you'd like to visit the adjoining park, we recommend arriving to the wedding early. Just outside of the lodge, there is a large public viewing point for visitors to see the falls, along with a wide, paved, and staired trail that runs through the surrounding park. The path is about a mile long and ends at the foot of the waterfall. Bring a pair of hiking boots or shoes with good tread and a raincoat for light to considerable spray and wet pathways.

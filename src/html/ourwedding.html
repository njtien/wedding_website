      <h2>About Our Wedding</h2>
      <p>We are having a small, intimate wedding at a lodge built along the side of a waterfall. Our ceremony will take place out on the terrace underneath a heated tent. Dinner will be served inside. Guests are welcome to slip in and out of doors throughout the evening to
        enjoy the view of the falls.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you'd like to visit the adjoining park, we recommend arriving to the wedding early. Just outside of the lodge, there is a large public viewing point for visitors to see the falls, along with a wide, paved and staired trail that runs through the surrounding park. The path is about a mile long and ends at the foot of the waterfall. Bring a pair of hiking boots or shoes with good tread and a raincoat for light to considerable spray and wet pathways.
